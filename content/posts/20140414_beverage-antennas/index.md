At my local radio club, one of the members likes to hop on the 80 metre band with his morse code key. We were discussing what might be some good topics for upcoming lectures, and he mentioned that he was curious about beverage antennas.

I didn’t know anthing about this topic, so I thought it would be great to go away, do some research and learn about them so I could deliver a lecture. It seems indeed that beverage antennas are a great option for receiving signals on the low bands, but they do require a huge amount of space, and are less well suited at a transmissing antenna.

The lecture was recorded and can be found on the club’s YouTube channel:
