One of the common complaints about the Sony A7 series of cameras is that they do not have a flip-around screen that allows you to frame the shot when you are taking a selfie. I managed to put together a solution for this out of some parts I had laying around.

It consists of:

-   Sony A7 series camera- Hotshoe adaptor with 1/4” screw
-   Smartphone holder which accepts 1/4” screw
-   Joby Gorillapod with Arca-Swiss mount to accept the plate on bottom of the camera (I use a Peak Design dual plate to make the camera compatible with both Arca
-   Swiss and Manfrotto RC2 mounts)
-   [optional] micro-USB shutter release cable (otherwise just use the self-timer on the camera)
-   Smartphone with Sony Imaging Edge app installed and paired to the camera

{{< figure src="20191004-253B8BE6-1017-4384-B870-2D8F56E98462.jpeg" >}}

In this way, the camera can be placed on the Joby gorillapod which acts as a “selfie stick”, and the remote view on the Sony Imaging Edge app on the smartphone allows you to frame the shot and you can tap it to release the shutter.

If I want to use this setup for video vlogging, there is nowhere to mount a shotgun mic, so likely I would use a lavalier mic plugged into the camera itself, or perhaps into a second smartphone acting as a voice recorder.
