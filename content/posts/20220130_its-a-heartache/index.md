On the Australian TV Series Doctor Doctor, there’s a recurring piece of music that is playing using fingerpicking on the ukulele based on Bonnie Tyler’s hit song It’s a Heartache. A quick search on YouTube discovered that it comes from the lead-in of a music video by the Wellington International Ukulele Orchestra:

I was keen to learn how to play something like it on my own ukulele, and a further search turned up a [tutorial by Helmut Bickel](https://youtu.be/pCswBsuddrc), where he has some hand-written tablature in the background of the video. To have the tab in a more convenient format, I wrote it up using the [lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) music typesetting software, and the resulting PDF is reproduced below:
